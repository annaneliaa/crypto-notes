\subsection{Notions of Security}
\subsubsection{Basic}
What does it mean for a symmetric encryption scheme to be secure? Adversary should not learn the underlying message: One Way-PASSive attack.

\subsubsection{Modern}
The adversary can also partially break the system. The adversary should not be allowed to obtain \textbf{any} information about the plaintext!

\begin{defn}
Semantic security: like perfect security but the adversary has polynomially bounded computing power. The adversary cannt extract partial knowledge. 
\end{defn}


\begin{defn}
IND Security: If a system is IND secure, it is also semantically secure.
\end{defn}
